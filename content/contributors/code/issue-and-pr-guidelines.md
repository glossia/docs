# Issue & PR Guidelines

Issues created in repositories, such as [glossia/glossia](https://github.com/glossia/glossia/issues), must be **well-scoped and accepted** before work begins.

- **Bug Reports**: If you found a bug, create an issue using the appropriate template and include a **minimal reproducible example**.
- **Feature Ideas & Improvements**: If you have an idea for a problem Glossia should solve or an improvement within its scope, please use the **forum for discussions** instead of the issue tracker.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The issue tracker is **not** for discussions.

### Pull Requests

If you open a PR, ensure it has an **associated issue**.
**Drive-by PRs will be immediately closed**—all contributions must be properly tracked.

## Why this approach?

This system ensures that maintainers and contributors can open the issues tab and immediately find **actionable, well-defined work**. Every issue is ready to be worked on, and PRs linked to issues have a high chance of being accepted.

Issue trackers often become cluttered with **Q&A, stale bug reports, and enhancement discussions**. Drive-by PRs create extra burden for maintainers, as they might introduce interesting features but in an undesirable way—forcing maintainers to reject them, which can be frustrating for everyone involved.

By keeping the issue tracker **focused and structured**, we make it easier for everyone to contribute effectively.
