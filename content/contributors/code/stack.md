# Stack

The following sections provide an overview of the Glossia stack. We try to keep our stack limited to a set of technologies that everyone can become familiar with. We continuously evaluate new technologies and solutions that emerge, considering them if they align with our values and principles and we believe they can have a positive impact in the long run.

## Tools

- [Mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise): We use Mise extensively as a frontend for development environments. You'll notice that all our repositories suggest cloning the repo and then running `mise install`. Mise will deterministically provision your environment to contribute to the repo. We then recommend using `mise run` to see what workflows are available for you to run locally.

## Technologies

- [Erlang and Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/): We believe the battle-tested Erlang runtime and the Elixir language, along with its toolchain, are a powerful combination for solving complex problems with simple solutions that aren't costly to maintain.
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/): We use 11ty to build static sites because it’s fast, easy to use, and—most importantly—captures the elegance of the web at its best.
